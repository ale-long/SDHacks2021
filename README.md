# Student Connect
devpost: https://devpost.com/software/student-connect-ynv42c/
## Inspiration
A web app that aggregates class group chats and provides their respective discord links or any other links so students would not have to spam FB group pages asking if certain gc have been made yet. This would save time and eliminate the inefficiency of having students post on top of each other on FB. 
## What it does
Centralized app for students to interact and find group chats for classes.
## How we built it
React, Firebase, Bootstrap
## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the frontend to the backend, and resolving problems with Firebase.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Accessing databases, learning more about React and other frameworks.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about Bootstrap, React, and how the backend connects to the frontend.
## What's next for Student Connect
More functionality, and more dynamic features in the future.
